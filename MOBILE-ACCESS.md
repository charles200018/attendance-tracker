   The script will display your computer's IP address and mobile URLs:
   ```
   Mobile Access URLs:

     Admin View:    http://192.168.0.163:3000/admin.html
   ```

3. **Connect Your Mobile Device**
   - Make sure your phone is on the **SAME Wi-Fi network** as your computer
   - Open your phone's browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.)
   - Enter the URL shown in the script: `http://YOUR-IP:3000/login.html`

- âœ“ Make sure both servers are running

**Problem: API connection error**
- âœ“ Restart both backend and frontend servers
- âœ“ Clear browser cache on mobile device
- âœ“ Check that backend is running on port 3002

**Allow Firewall Access (if needed)**
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Attendance Tracker Frontend" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 3000 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Attendance Tracker Backend" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 3002 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
```

### Stopping the Servers

Press `Ctrl+C` in the PowerShell windows or close them.

   - Tap the Share/Menu button
   - Select "Add to Home Screen"
   - Now you can launch it like a native app!
